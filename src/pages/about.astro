      <p>
        I'm a software engineer focused on creating tools that solve real problems.
        I believe in the power of simple, well-crafted solutions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My work spans web development, system design, and product strategy.
        I'm particularly interested in the intersection of technology and human needs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, exploring new places, and 
        conversations about design, philosophy, and the future of technology.
